# HTML and CSS Project - Client Homepage

## Project Overview
This project has acquired the necessary skills and knowledge to develop a homepage for a fictional client using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a well-structured webpage with semantic elements, incorporating a header, main content, and footer. The project requirements are as follows:
- **Header**: The client's logo is prominently displayed in the header section.
- **Main Content**: The main content area features a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing both images and text.
- **Footer**: The footer is divided into two columns. The left column displays a smaller version of the client's logo, and the right column contains copyright information.
