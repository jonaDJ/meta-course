## Overview

This Git repository contains the code for a project I developed as part of my META course. The project encompasses various aspects of web development and user experience design, including HTML/CSS web pages, React applications, and UX/UI design using Figma.

The project is divided into the following components:

1. **HTML and CSS Webpage**: A single-page restaurant website built using HTML and CSS.

3. **Advanced React**: A multi-page React application with the following sections:
   - About Me: A page that provides information about me.
