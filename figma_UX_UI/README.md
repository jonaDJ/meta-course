# Little Lemon Restaurant - Reserve a Table & Food Menu Feature

## Project Overview

This project encompasses the design and prototyping of two essential features for the mobile version of the Little Lemon restaurant website: the "Reserve a Table" and "Food Menu" features. The objective is to create an engaging and user-friendly online reservation system and a visually appealing menu presentation. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: Little Lemon restaurant currently lacks an online reservation system and an accessible digital food menu. This project addresses both these issues, enhancing customer experience.

2. **User Persona**: To understand the target audience, I have created a user persona. 

3. **Journey Map**: A journey map has been developed to visualize the user's experience, from discovering the website to successfully booking a table and exploring the food menu. 

4. **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity wireframes have been created in Figma to outline the features and functionality of both the reservation and menu systems. 

5. **High-Fidelity Prototype**: An interactive high-fidelity prototype has been developed in Figma, adhering to the best design principles learned throughout the course. The prototype includes at least two interactive components and links multiple screens together. 

## Problem Statement

Little Lemon restaurant faces two key challenges: the absence of an online reservation system and an outdated paper-based food menu. This project aims to address both problems by introducing user-friendly solutions that streamline table booking and enhance the digital presentation of the food menu.

## Journey Map

I have created a journey map to visualize Sarah's experience when using the "Reserve a Table" and "Food Menu" features on the Little Lemon restaurant website. The map highlights key touchpoints and emotions throughout her journey.



## Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes have been designed to outline the features and functionality of both the reservation and menu systems. These wireframes provide a clear representation of how users will interact with the features.



## High-Fidelity Prototype

An interactive high-fidelity prototype has been developed, incorporating best design practices. The prototype includes interactive components such as buttons, navigation, and menu item selection. It links multiple screens together to demonstrate the reservation process and food menu exploration.
